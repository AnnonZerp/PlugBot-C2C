                  The concept for PlugBot was conceived in February of 2010 during the surge of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_computer" target="_blank">"plug computers"</a> into the tech market. The founder wanted to give something back to the infosec community after being a 
                 long-time user of open source tools like nmap and Metasploit. 
                 Hopefully you will find something useful in PlugBot and be 
                 inspired to contribute to the open source movement as well.
                  <br><br>
                 PlugBot aims to challenge technical as well as physical security. 
                 It is a security research project by <a href="http://www.redteamsecure.com/" target="_blank">RedTeam Security</a>, led by Jeremiah Talamantes. It is designed to be a proof-of-concept / experimental foray into the development of software that could potentially support the concept of a hardware botnet. The project is made up of two components, PlugBot Bot and PlugBot Command & Control. The hardware component to this project is intended to be a plug computer or single-board computers, such as: Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, Cubox, etc.</p>
              <p>Jeremiah is an information security consultant, not a developer. Therefore much help is needed to improve the project all around. If you're proficient in PHP / CodeIgniter and want to contribute, contact jeremiah[at]redteamsecure[dot]com. Help is greatly needed!</p>
